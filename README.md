# Leaf & Light

### Overview

You’re a tree fighting for the sun's light while competing against other trees. A more competitive style game that is turn based and has limited controls to keep it simple. There's a small amount of space to grow in and with each turn you decide where you want to spend your tree energy in order to get more light.

When you collect the sunlight it’s stored as “tree energy” which you spend per turn to grow a new branch. Each branch will automatically have leaves on it to start getting that sunlight.

**Idea/Concept**: A tree needs sun to grow. Collect sunlight with your branches and leaves to keep yourself alive.

**Goals**: Take turns against other trees to decide a path for growing new branches to collect sunlight.

**Win Condition**: Maybe you could grow forever or if you can get to a 100% absorption rate (haven’t decided on it yet)
